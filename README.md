# Pryus

Create a new branch each group for each cohort and change the constant `PEOPLE` to include the
names of your group.

You can then generate a unique pair by running `ruby app.rb`.

Each pair that is used will be recorded in the CSV and used to make sure you
don't repeat in the future.

Derp.
